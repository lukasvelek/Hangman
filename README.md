# Hangman
A little project that has been made just because of boredom. Probably useless but shows my knowledge of Java and documentation.

## Version 1.1
The hangman has been divided into four stages and is being displayed after every wrongly guessed letter (that has not already been used). Also some bugfixes have been done.

## Version 1.0
Fully functional although the hangman is not hangman, it's actually something that cannot be described easily. However it will be worked on and functional as well in the upcoming update.
Currently the user enters the word and then enters letters that are checked whether they appear in the word. If the game is won the player is asked whether they want to continue or not.
if not the game terminates the process and if yes it repeats.
